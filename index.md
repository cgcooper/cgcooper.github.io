I’m a product manager who has been building user-focused digital products for more than a decade in Toronto, Ontario. You might know me from my previous work at...

- **LMN (Landscape Management Network)**, where I drove the launch of new quoting, proposal, and crew management tools that thousands of contractors rely on every day; and was instrumental in ensuring roadmap continuity during one of the largest mergers in the history of the green industry.
- **Tarion**, where I bridged business and engineering teams to modernize homeowner-facing web platforms, streamlining how thousands of new homebuyers accessed critical information and services.

Currently I'm on the lookout for my next full-time role in Product Management or Product Operations, and helping great folks out with their websites (or even with your product strategy more holistically) along the way.

Interested in working together? Please connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cgcooper). I'm looking forward to connecting!
